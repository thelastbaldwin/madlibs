Madlibs
=======

This is just a basic madlibs-style program meant to help me learn different languages. The idea is to take the following basic set of functionality and tranlate it into different languages.

* interpret command line arguments
* open a file
* prompt for user input based on the number of tags in the file
* interpolate the substitutions into the template
* output the madlib to the console
